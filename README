iPhone OData Demo Application

Demo iPhone application that uses an OData service to provide
a list of entities and to manipulate those entities. A work
in progress...

Configured to use public demo OData service on the Advantage Database
Server developer's portal (devzone.AdvantageDatabase.com). To modify
this to point to your own service, open the project's ConfigSettings.plist
file and modify the "Service URI" key.

  or device lib based on project configuration.
