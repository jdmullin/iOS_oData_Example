iPhone OData Demo Application

Demo iPhone application that uses an OData service to provide
a list of entities and to manipulate those entities. A work
in progress...

Configured to use public demo OData service on the Advantage Database
Server developer's portal (devzone.AdvantageDatabase.com). To modify
this to point to your own service, open the project's ConfigSettings.plist
file and modify the "Service URI" key.

TODO:
- Currently links directly to the iPhone simulator version
  of the OData library. Need to modify to link to simulator
  or device lib based on project configuration.
- The OData lib the demo uses was built with iOS SDK version 4.3. Because 
  of this your mileage may vary, see next TODO item for what will hopefully
  fix this in the future.
- Need to work with OData lib authors to turn it into a "standard"
  framework that can be linked via multiple SDK's and debug/release
  configurations.

Requirements:
- XCode 4
- iOS SDK 4.3
