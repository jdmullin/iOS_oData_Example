iPhone OData Demo Application

Demo iPhone application that uses an OData service to provide
a list of entities and to manipulate those entities. A work
in progress...

Current Functionality:
- Read dataset asynchronously
- Insert/Update/Delete entities

Future Functionality:
- Paging support
- Filter and OrderBy 

TODO:
- Bundle OData library with demo so no external libs or
  search path need to be configured.
- Make URL configurable via the application, currently
  hard-coded in the app delegate.
